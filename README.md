# SafeGuard Bank - Pan Card Tampering Detector

Welcome to the SafeGuard Bank Pan Card Tampering Detector repository! Here, we aim to develop an innovative computer vision application to detect tampering in PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards.

## üåü Introduction

At SafeGuard Bank, we understand the importance of maintaining the integrity and security of financial documents. PAN cards serve as a crucial identification document for individuals, and any tampering or fraudulent activities related to PAN cards can have severe consequences.

To combat this issue, we are developing an advanced computer vision-based solution that can detect tampering in PAN cards with high accuracy. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques, we aim to create a reliable system that can identify any unauthorized alterations or modifications to PAN cards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Details

In this repository, you will find the Jupyter Notebook file `pan_card_tampering.ipynb`, which contains the code and necessary instructions to build the Pan Card Tampering Detector. The notebook imports the required data and implements the tampering detection algorithm using computer vision techniques.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Pan Card Tampering Detector, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `pan_card_tampering.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to import the data and execute the tampering detection algorithm.
4. Customize and enhance the code as needed to suit your specific requirements.
